<img src="baked chicken alfredo.webp" alt="" class="center">

<h2>This recipe is quick and easy and any novice cook can do it.</h2>

    Serve with additional Parmesan cheese if desired. 
    This recipe can also be eaten without 
    being baked but the kids love that it r
    esembles baked casseroles found in restaurants.</p>

    <li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
    
    <li>½ cup butter</li>
    
   <li> 2 teaspoons minced garlic </li>
    
   <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
    
   <li> 2 cups milk</li>
    
    <li>6 ounces grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
    
   <li> 2 teaspoons dried parsley</li>
    
   <li> 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    
  <li>  1 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
    
  <li>  ½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    
  <li>  1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
    
   <li> 2 chicken breasts, patted dry</li>
    
    <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
</div>

 </ul>  
 
 <h2>Steps</h2>

 <ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add minced garlic; saute until golden, about 30 seconds. Stir in cream cheese until smooth. Add milk; stir until there are no lumps. Lower heat to medium. Add 3/4 of the Parmesan cheese, parsley, Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and black pepper. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over low heat. Season chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt and garlic powder on both sides. Cook chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 6 minutes per side. Cut chicken into 1/2-inch cubes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <br>
    <li>Butter bottom and sides of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Cover bottom with a layer of pasta. Place half of the chicken cubes on top. Pour 1/2 of the sauce over the chicken. Repeat layering pasta, chicken, and sauce. Sprinkle top with remaining Parmesan cheese. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly, about 15 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and bake until cheese is golden, about 5 minutes more.</li>
